Given an integer between 1 and 10,000, return a count of how many numbers from 1 up to that integer whose square contains at least one digit 3.

Tests
Waiting:1. squaresWithThree(1) should return 0.
Waiting:2. squaresWithThree(10) should return 1.
Waiting:3. squaresWithThree(100) should return 19.
Waiting:4. squaresWithThree(1000) should return 326.
Waiting:5. squaresWithThree(10000) should return 4531.
